## Introduction 
NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and many mathematical functions that operate on these data structures. This repository contains examples that cover a wide range of NumPy functionalities, from basic operations to more advanced techniques.

## Installation
To run the examples provided in this repository, you need to have Python and NumPy installed. You can install NumPy using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy

## Usage
Each example is contained in its own Python file within the `examples` directory. You can run these examples directly to see the output and understand how each function works.

### Basic Examples
