## Introduction
House prices are a common dataset used in data analysis to understand market trends, predict future prices, and identify factors influencing price changes. In this project, we will use NumPy to perform basic analysis on a house price dataset. This project is designed for beginners to get hands-on experience with NumPy.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a fictional dataset containing information about houses, including:
- `Price`: The price of the house.
- `Size`: The size of the house in square feet.
- `Bedrooms`: The number of bedrooms.
- `Age`: The age of the house in years.

You can find the dataset in the `data` directory.

## Learning Objectives
Through this project, you will learn:
1. How to load and manipulate data using NumPy arrays.
2. Basic statistical analysis using NumPy functions.
3. Data transformation and cleaning techniques.
4. How to visualize data trends using simple plots.

## Installation
To run the code in this project, you need to have Python and NumPy installed. You can install NumPy using pip:

pip install numpy

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

- data/: Contains the house price dataset.
- examples/: Contains Python scripts demonstrating various NumPy functionalities.
- load_data.py: Script to load and display the dataset.
- basic_statistics.py: Script to calculate basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation).
- data_transformation.py: Script to perform data transformations (normalization, sorting).
- visualization.py: Script to visualize data trends (scatter plot, histogram).

## Usage
You can run each example script to learn how to use NumPy for different tasks. Here is a brief description of each script:

1. Load Data
This script demonstrates how to load data from a CSV file into a NumPy array.
